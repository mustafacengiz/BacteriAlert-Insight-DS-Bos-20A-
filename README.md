A machine learning project predicting bacterial beach water pollution in Florida.
This repo contains the code for my data science project during my fellowship at Insight Data Science 20A session in Boston.
The outcome is a model, created by Random Forests algorithm, that predicts bacterial beach water pollution in Florida within seven days.
It covers 126 beaches in 26 coastal Florida counties.
